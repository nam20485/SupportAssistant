# SupportAssistant Application Implementation

## Overview

Implement the **SupportAssistant** application - a free, open-source Windows desktop application that provides intelligent, contextual technical assistance using a local Small Language Model (SLM). This application leverages a local, on-device AI architecture to ensure maximum privacy, offline capability, and financial sustainability for FOSS distribution.
